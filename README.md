# Thesis Review System

## The project aims to review *"theses"* for students in Bachelor's and Master's level of education. Through modern technology stack, a web application is developed with different functionalities for three different users (admin, reviewer, and student).

### Admin roles:
1) Assign/Reassign theses to reviewers
2) Approve reviewer accounts
3) Add or remove students and/or reviewers in the platform

### Reviewer roles:
1) Make reviews to student theses
2) Submit feedback with review grade

### Student roles:
1) Submit pdf file of thesis for review
2) Fill in the correct details before submission

## The Client is in the client directory (developed with ReactJS) and The Server is in the server directory (developed with NodeJS, Typescript, MongoDB) and they are both connected using Axios.
## Assessment of thesis using Machine-learning is also implemented through backend.

#### *For further instructions, open each directory containing corresponding information for each of the two parts of the application (Client and Server)
